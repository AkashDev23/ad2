Contributions are always welcome!

But currently I don't want any logical edit in this. 

You can edit the design if you want that too only after raising an issue. 

Thanks‚ù§Ô∏è

### Problem Statement
Finding the Shortest Route in a Transportation Network

Suppose you are working on a transportation management system, and you need to find the shortest route for a delivery vehicle to travel from one location to another in a complex network of roads or routes. Your project can help solve this problem by implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the source and destination locations.

In this scenario, you can represent each location as a node in the graph and the roads or routes as edges between the nodes. The weight of each edge can represent the distance, travel time, or any other metric relevant to the transportation network.

By inputting the source and destination locations into your project, it can calculate and display the shortest path for the delivery vehicle to follow, helping optimize the delivery route and minimize travel time or distance.
